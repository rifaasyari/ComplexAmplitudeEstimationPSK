A document and software for estimators of complex amplitude and carrier phase of phase-shift keyed communications signals.  Run the

build.sh

bash script to compile the plots and the latex document paper.tex.  The software (and plot data) is in the /code folder.  The script

runsim.sh

will run the simulations.  You require scala 2.9.x to run the simulations.
