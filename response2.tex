\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} [31] N. Noels, V. Lottici, \dots \\
\textbf{Response:}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comments from reviewer 2}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Comment:} In the abstract: non data-aided $\to$ change to: non-data-aided \\
\textbf{Response:} Fixed.

\item \textbf{Comment:} ``we assume that the time-offset has been previously handled'' $\to$ perhaps some motivation for this assumption and the consequences with respect to the system model would be in place \\
\textbf{Response:}  There exist numerous estimators for the time offset in the literature.  We have added the sentence 

``Methods for estimating the time offset are given in~\cite{Massey1972optimumframe,Oerder_synch_square_circstat_2008,McKilliam_time_offset_pilots_data_2013}.'' 

to inform the reader of some of these methods.  The interested reader will find further discussion about time offset estimation within these references.  The assumption of an accurate time offset estimator is common in this literature~\cite{ViterbiViterbi_phase_est_1983,Cowley_ref_sym_carr_1998,Wilson1989,Makrakis1990,Liu1991,Mackenthun1994,Sweldens2001,McKilliamLinearTimeBlockPSK2009,Divsalar1990}.


\item \textbf{Comment:} ``such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK), \dots'' $\to$ mentioning BPSK and QPSK apart from general M-PSK is pure overhead in this stage, I would drop it \\
\textbf{Response:} Done.

\item \textbf{Comment:} ``the data symbols are not known to the receiver and must also be estimated'' $\to$ I would drop the second part of the sentence because (e.g. Viterbi and Vterbi estimator) non-data-aided estimators typically do not actually estimate the unknown data symbols \\
\textbf{Response:} Done.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 3: ``bounds that are valid asymptoticially'': typo in asymptotically \\
\textbf{Response:} Fixed.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 3: ``all of the exiting bounds are applicable only in the fully non-data-aided case or in the completely data aided case \dots'' --> bounds for the common scenario where there is a mixture of pilot and data symbols can be found in "N. Noels, H. Steendam, M. Moeneclaey en H. Bruneel, Carrier Phase and Frequency Estimation for Pilot Symbol Assisted Transmission: Bounds and Algorithms, IEEE TSP, Vol. 53, No. 12, p. 4578-4587, Dec. 2005. \\
\textbf{Response:} BLERG. I've removed this paragraph from the introduction but will have to update the code and simulations.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 3: ``the situations is'' --> drop `s' at the end of situations \\
\textbf{Response:} Fixed.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 3: in continuous text I prefer the use of ``approached infinity'' rather than ``$\to \infty$'' \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 3: last line: typo in ``convincing'' \\
\textbf{Response:} Fixed.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 4: ``systems such as mulitple anntannae'' $\to$ should be ``multiple antennae'' \\
\textbf{Response:} Reviewer 1 comment~\eqref{eq:rev1:multantenna} wanted ``antenna'' and I have used this spelling.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 4: ``the other reciever components'' $\to$ should be ``receiver components'' \\
\textbf{Response:} Fixed.

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 5 (and further throughout the text): ``pilots symbols" (with `s') and ``pilot symbols'' (without `s') are both used $\to$ use only 1, I prefer ``pilot symbols'' \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} I think it would be a good idea to specify the main notational conventions at the end of the introductory section \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} between (5) and (6): start new paragraph \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} before (6): drop the 'to' \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} before (7): change ``for given $\theta$'' to ``for given $\theta$ and $\rho$'' \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} what is the use of keeping the constants `A' and `B' in the expressions $\to$ can they not be dropped? \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} I would prefer to see comma's between two subindices; so, `$k,i$' rather than`'$ki$' \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} below (11) '$g_{ik}$' should be '$g_{ki}$' (change order of the subscripts) \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} I would prefer to see brackets around the functions of which the mean is computed (use of the operator $\mathbb E$) \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 12: ``the amplitude estimation error with bias removed'' $\to$ bit strange formulation \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 14: "Equivalently $\hat\theta$ is the maximiser of \dots" $\to$ could you please provide some further explanation (is the maximum of $\Re(Z(\theta)$) never negative? and why) \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 15: the use of `A' as notation for a sample space is confusing since `A' has already been used as a constant \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} in general, I find the numerical results section rather short \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} although different figures are shown for M=2,4,8 (phase estimation), the effect of the constellation size is not addressed in the text  \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 18, first sentence: ``when $L$ is sufficiently large'' $\to$ in these figures the value of $L$ is fixed, should this be ``when the SNR is sufficiently large''  \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p. 18, first sentence: a qualitative explanation for the fact the theory and simulations diverge at low SNR would be appreciated  \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:} p.18, last sentence of first paragraph: ``non-data aided'' $\to$ should be ``non-data-aided''  \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  although the most important contribution of the paper is with respect to the biased amplitude estimate, only 1 figure is presented for amplitude estimation, namely for L=2048 and BPSK --> this seems not well balanced  \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  a separate plot of the two terms that contribute to Fig. 4 would be welcome \\
\textbf{Response:}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comments from reviewer 3}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  Eq. (14) would be easier to follow with the intermediate step inserted $\dots = (a_0s_i + w_i)/(a_0s_i) = \dots$ \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  There are many formulas (starting from page 11) with the notation $\fracpart{x}$ meaning ``$x$ taken modulo $2\pi/M$''. These angle brackets don't strike the eye and can be easily confused with ordinary parentheses. To make them much more visible, the authors could use the same approach as for ``$x$ taken modulo $2\pi$'' - by using corresponding subscript, i.e. use $\fracpart{x}_{2\pi/M}$ instead of $\fracpart{x}$. \\
\textbf{Response:}

 \end{enumerate}

\section{Comments from reviewer 4}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  The variable  ``a'' in the equation 2 is not defined in the text \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  There are typografical errors in the words  ``multiple antenna'' in line 2, page 2, section 1 \\
\textbf{Response:}

\item \textbf{Comment:}  And also in the word ``receiver" in line 28 of the same page.
 \\
\textbf{Response:}
