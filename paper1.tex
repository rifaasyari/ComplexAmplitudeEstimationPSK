\begin{abstract}
We consider least squares estimators of carrier phase and amplitude from a noisy communications signal that contains both pilot signals, known to the receiver, and data signals, unknown to the receiver.  We focus on signaling constellations that have symbols evenly distributed on the complex unit circle, i.e., $M$-ary phase shift keying.  We show, under reasonably mild conditions on the distribution of the noise, that the least squares estimator of carrier phase is strongly consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.  However, the amplitude estimator is not consistent, it converges to a positive real number that is a function of the true carrier amplitude, the noise distribution, and the size of the constellation.  Our theoretical results can also be applied to the case where no pilot symbols exist, i.e., noncoherent detection.  The results of Monte Carlo simulations are provided and these agree with the theoretical results.

\section{Introduction}

In passband communication systems the transmitted signal typically undergoes time offset (delay), phase shift and attenuation (amplitude change).  These effects must be compensated for at the receiver. In this paper we assume that the time offset has been previously handled, and we focus on estimating the phase shift and attenuation.  We consider signalling constellations that have symbols evenly distributed on the complex unit circle such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) and $M$-ary phase shift keying ($M$-PSK).  In this case, the transmitted symbols take the form,
\[
s_i = e^{j u_i},
\]
where $j = \sqrt{-1}$ and $u_i$ is from the set $\{0, \tfrac{2\pi}{M}, \dots, \tfrac{2\pi(M-1)}{M}\}$ and $M \geq 2$ is the size of the constellation.  We assume that some of the transmitted symbols are \emph{pilot symbols} known to the receiver and the remainder are information carrying \emph{data symbols} with phase that is unknown to the receiver.  So,
\[
s_i = \begin{cases}
p_i & i \in P \\
d_i & i \in D,
\end{cases}
\]
where $P$ is the set of indices describing the position of the pilot symbols $p_i$, and $D$ is a set of indices describing the position of the data symbols $d_i$.  The sets $P$ and $D$ are disjoint, i.e. $P \cap D = \emptyset$, and $L = \abs{P \cup D}$ is the total number of symbols transmitted.

We assume that time offset estimation has been performed and that $L$ noisy $M$-PSK symbols are observed by the receiver.  The received signal is then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sigmod}
y_i = a_0 s_i + w_i, \qquad i \in P \cup D,
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ is noise and $a_0 = \rho_0 e^{j\theta_0}$ is a complex number representing both carrier phase $\theta_0$ and amplitude $\rho_0$ (by definition $\rho_0$ is a positive real number).  Our aim is to estimate $a_0$ from the noisy symbols $\{ y_i, i \in P \cup D \}$.  Complicating matters is that the data symbols $\{d_i, i \in D\}$ are not known to the receiver and must also be estimated.  Estimation problems of this type have undergone extensive prior study~\cite{ViterbiViterbi_phase_est_1983,Cowley_ref_sym_carr_1998,Wilson1989,Makrakis1990,Liu1991,Mackenthun1994,Sweldens2001,McKilliamLinearTimeBlockPSK2009,Divsalar1990}.  A practical approach is the least squares estimator, that is, the minimisers of the sum of squares function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SSdefn}
\begin{split}
SS(a, &\{d_i, i \in D\}) = \sum_{i \in P \cup D} \abs{ y_i - a s_i }^2  \\
&= \sum_{i \in P} \abs{ y_i - a s_i }^2 + \sum_{i \in D} \abs{ y_i - a d_i }^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\abs{x}$ denotes the magnitude of the complex number $x$.  The least squares estimator is also the maximum likelihood estimator under the assumption that the noise sequence $\{w_i, i \in \ints\}$ is additive white and Gaussian.  However, as we will show, the estimator works well under less stringent assumptions.  %It is the least squares estimator that we primarily study in this paper.

The existing literature~\cite{Mackenthun1994,Cowley_ref_sym_carr_1998,ViterbiViterbi_phase_est_1983,Sweldens2001,Wilson1989,Makrakis1990,Liu1991} mostly considers what is called \emph{noncoherent detection} where no pilot symbols exist ($P = \emptyset$ where $\emptyset$ is the empty set).  In the nocoherent setting \emph{differential encoding} is often used, and for this reason the estimation problem has been called \emph{multiple symbol differential detection}.  A popular approach is the so called \emph{non-data aided}, sometimes also called \emph{non-decision directed}, estimator based on the paper of Viterbi and Viterbi~\cite{ViterbiViterbi_phase_est_1983}.  The idea is to `strip' the modulation from the recieved signal by taking $y_i / \abs{y_i}$ to the power of $M$.  A function $F: \reals \mapsto \reals$ is chosen and the estimator of the carrier phase $\theta_0$ is taken to be $\tfrac{1}{M}\angle{A}$ where $\angle$ denotes the complex argument and
\[
A = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{i \in P \cup D} F(\abs{y_i}) \big(\tfrac{y_i}{\abs{y_i}}\big)^M.
\]
Various choices for $F$ are suggested in~\cite{ViterbiViterbi_phase_est_1983} and a statistical analysis is presented.  A caveat of this estimator is that it is not entirely obvious how pilot symbols should be included. Techniques are available but they are somewhat adhoc~\cite{Cowley_ref_sym_carr_1998}.  This problem does not occur with the least square estimator.

An important paper is by Mackenthun~\cite{Mackenthun1994} who described an algorithm to compute the least squares estimator requiring only $O(L \log L)$ arithmetic operations.  Sweldens~\cite{Sweldens2001} rediscovered Mackenthun's algorithm in 2001.  Both Mackenthun and Swelden's considered only the noncoherent setting, but we show in Section~\ref{sec:least-squar-estim}~that Mackenthun's algorithm can be modified to include pilot symbols. Our model includes the noncoherent case by setting the number of pilot symbols to zero, that is, putting $P = \emptyset$.  

In the literature it has been common to assume that the data symbols $\{d_i, i \in D\}$ are of primary interest and that the complex amplitude $a_0$ is a nuisance parameter.  The metric of performance is correspondingly \emph{symbol error rate}, or \emph{bit error rate}.  Whilst estimating the symbols (or more precisely the transmitted bits) is ultimately the goal, we take the opposite approach here.  Our aim is to estimate $a_0$, and we treat the unknown data symbols as nuisance parameters.  This is motivated by the fact that in many modern communication systems the data symbols are \emph{coded}.  For this reason raw symbol error rate is not of interest at this stage.  Instead, we desire an accurate estimator $\hat{a}$ of $a_0$, so that the compensated recieved symbols $\hat{a}^{-1}y_i$ can be accurately modelled using an additive noise channel.  The additive noise channel is a common assumption for subsequent reciever operations, such as decoding.  The estimator $\hat{a}$ is also used in the computation of decoder metrics for modern decoders, and for interference cancellation in multiuser systems.  Consequently, our metric of performance will not be symbol or bit error rate, it will be $\abs{a_0 - \hat{a}}^2$. It will actually be informative to consider the carrier phase and amplitude estimators separately, that is, if $\hat{a} = \hat{\rho}e^{j\hat{\theta}}$ where $\hat{\rho}$ is a positive real number, then we consider $\langle\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}\rangle_\pi^2$ and $(\rho_0 - \hat{\rho})^2$.  The function $\fracpart{\cdot}_\pi$ denotes its argument taken `modulo $2\pi$' into the interval $[-\pi, \pi)$.  It will become apparent why $\langle\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}\rangle_\pi^2$ rather than $(\theta_0 - \hat{\theta})^2$ is the appropriate measure of error for the phase parameter.

The paper is organised in the following way.  Section~\ref{sec:least-squar-estim} extends Mackenthun's algorithm for the coherent case, when both pilot symbols and data symbols exist.  Section~\ref{sec:circ-symm-compl} describes properties of complex random variables that we need.  Section~\ref{sec:stat-prop-least} states two theorems that describe the statistical properties of the least squares estimator of carrier phase $\hat{\theta}$ and amplitude $\hat{\rho}$.  We show, under some assumptions about the distribution of the noise $w_1,\dots,w_L$, that $\langle\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}\rangle^2$ converges almost surely to zero and that $\sqrt{L}\langle\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}\rangle^2$ is asymptotically normally distributed as $L\rightarrow \infty$.  However, $\hat{\rho}$ is not a consistent estimator of the amplitude $\rho_0$.  The bias of $\hat{\rho}$ is small when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is large, but the bias is significant when the SNR is small.  Sections~\ref{sec:proof-almost-sure} and~\ref{sec:proof-asympt-norm} provide proofs of the theorems stated in Section~\ref{sec:stat-prop-least}.  Due to space constraints, the lemmas needed by these proofs have been placed in the supplementary paper~\cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKpilotsdata_2012appendix}.  In Section~\ref{sec:gaussian-noise-case} we consider the special case when the noise is Gaussian.  In this case, our expressions for the asymptotic distribution can be simplified.  Section~\ref{sec:simulations} presents the results of Monte-Carlo simulations.  These simulations agree with the derived asymptotic properties. 

%It is worth commenting on our use of $\prob$ rather than the more usual $\expect$ or $E$ for the expected value operator.  The notation comes from Pollard~\cite[Ch 1]{Pollard_users_guide_prob_2002}.  The notation is good because it removes unecessary distinction between `probability' and expectation.  Given a random variable $X$ with cumulative density function $F$, the probability of an event, say $X \in S$, where $S$ is some subset of the range of $X$, is 
%\[
%\prob \indicator \{X \in S\} = \int \indicator \{X \in S\}(x) dF(x) = \int_{S} dF(x)
%\]
%where $\indicator \{X \in S\}$ is the indicator function of the set $S$, i.e $\indicator \{X \in S\}(x) = 1$ when the argument $x \in S$ and zero otherwise.  We will usually drop the $\onebf$ and simply write $\prob \{ X \in S \}$ to mean $\prob \onebf\{ X \in S \}$.  To illustrate the utility of this notation, Markov's inequality becomes 
%\[
%\prob \{ \abs{X} > \delta \}  \leq \prob \frac{\abs{X}}{\delta}\onebf\{ \abs{X} > \delta \} \leq \frac{1}{\delta}\prob\abs{X},
%\]
%where $\frac{\abs{X}}{\delta}\onebf\{ \abs{X} > \delta \}(x)$ is the function equal to $\abs{x}/\delta$ when the argument $x > \delta$ and zero otherwise.

\section{Mackenthun's algorithm with pilots}\label{sec:least-squar-estim}

In this section we derive Mackentun's algorithm to compute the least squares estimator of the carrier phase and amplitude~\cite{Mackenthun1994}.  Mackenthun specifically considered the noncoherent setting, so we modify the algorithm to include the pilot symbols.  For the purpose of anaylsing computational complexity, we will assume that the number of data symbols $\abs{D}$ is proportional to the total number of symbols $L$, so that, for example, $O(L) = O(\abs{D})$.  In this case Mackentun's algorithm requires $O(L \log L)$ arithmetic operations.  This complexity arises from the need to sort a list of $\abs{D}$ elements.  
%We use order notation in the standard way, that is, for functions $h$ and $g$, we write $h(N) = O(g(N))$ to mean that there exists a constant $K > 0$ and a finite $N_0$ such that $h(N) \leq K g(N)$ for all $N > N_0$.

%In Section~\ref{sec:line-time-algor} we will show that a full sort is not neccesary, and that the least squares estimator can be implemented in $O(L)$ operations.

Define the sum of squares function
\begin{align}
SS(a, &\{d_i, i \in D\}) = \sum_{i \in P \cup D} \abs{ y_i - a s_i }^2 \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{i \in P \cup D} \abs{y_i}^2 - a s_i y_i^* - a^* s_i^* y_i + aa^*, \label{eq:SS}
\end{align}
where $*$ denotes the complex conjugate.  Fixing the data symbols $\{d_i, i \in D\}$, differentiating with respect to $a^*$, and setting the resulting equation to zero we find the least squares estimator of $a_0$ as a function of $\{d_i, i \in D\}$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hata}
\hat{a}(\{d_i, i \in D\}) = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i \in P \cup D} y_i s_i^* = \frac{1}{L} Y
\end{equation}
where $L = \abs{P \cup D}$ is the total number of symbols transmitted, and to simplify our notation we have put 
\[
Y = \sum_{i \in P \cup D} y_i s_i^* = \sum_{i \in P } y_i p_i^* + \sum_{i \in D } y_i d_i^*.
\]  
Note that $Y$ is a function of the unknown data symbols $\{ d_i, i \in D\}$ and we could write $Y(\{ d_i, i \in D\})$, but have chosen to suppress the argument $(\{ d_i, i \in D\})$ for notational clarity.  Substituting $\frac{1}{L}Y$ for $a$ into~\eqref{eq:SS} we obtain the $SS$ conditioned on minimisation with respect to $a$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SSdatasymbols}
SS(\{d_i, i \in D\}) = A - \frac{1}{L}\abs{Y}^2,
\end{equation}
where $A = \sum_{i \in P \cup D}\abs{y_i}^2$ is a constant.  Observe that given candidate values for the data symbols, we can compute the corresponding $SS(\{d_i, i \in D\})$ in $O(L)$ arithmetic operations.  It turns out that there are at most $(M+1)\abs{D}$ candidate values of the least squares estimator of the data symbols~\cite{Sweldens2001,Mackenthun1994}.  %When the number of data symbols is not small, this set is substantially smaller than the entire set of possible transmitted symbols, which is of size $M^{\abs{D}}$.

To see this, let $a = \rho e^{j\theta}$ where $\rho$ is a nonnegative real.  Now,
\begin{align}
SS(\rho, \theta, &\{d_i, i \in D\}) = \sum_{i \in P \cup D} \abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} s_i }^2  \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{i \in P} \abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} p_i }^2 + \sum_{i \in D} \abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} d_i }^2. \label{eq:SSallparams}
\end{align}
For given $\theta$, the least squares estimator of the $i$th data symbol $d_i$ is given by minimising $\abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} d_i }^2$, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hatdfinxtheta}
\hat{d}_i(\theta) = e^{j\hat{u}_i(\theta)} \qquad \text{where} \qquad \hat{u}_i(\theta) = \round{\angle( e^{-j\theta}y_i)},
\end{equation}
where $\angle(\cdot)$ denotes the complex argument (or phase), and $\round{\cdot}$ rounds its argument to the nearest multiple of $\frac{2\pi}{M}$.  A word of caution, the notation $\round{\cdot}$ is often used to denote rounding to the nearest \emph{integer}.  This is not the case here.  If the function $\operatorname{round}(\cdot)$ takes its argument to the nearest integer then,
\[
\round{x} = \tfrac{2\pi}{M}\operatorname{round}\left(\tfrac{M}{2\pi}x\right).
\] 
Note that $\hat{d}_i(\theta)$ does not depend on $\rho$.  As defined, $\hat{u}_i(\theta)$ is not strictly inside the set $\{0, \tfrac{2\pi}{M}, \dots, \tfrac{2\pi(M-1)}{M}\}$, but this is not of consequence, as we intend its value to be considered equivalent modulo $2\pi$.  With this in mind,
\[
\hat{u}_i(\theta) = \round{\angle{y_i} - \theta }
\]
which is equivalent to the definition from~\eqref{eq:hatdfinxtheta} modulo $2\pi$.

We only require to consider $\theta$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$.  Consider how $\hat{d}_i(\theta)$ changes as $\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\pi$.  Let $b_i = \hat{d}_i(0)$ and let 
\[
z_i = \angle{y_i} - \hat{u}_i(0) = \angle{y_i} - \round{\angle{y_i}}.
\]
Then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uicombos}
\hat{d}_i(\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
b_i, &  0 \leq \theta < z_i + \frac{\pi}{M} \\
b_i e^{-j2\pi/M}, & z_i + \frac{\pi}{M} \leq \theta < z_i + \frac{3\pi}{M} \\ 
\vdots & \\
b_i e^{-j2\pi k /M}, & z_i + \frac{\pi(2k - 1)}{M} \leq \theta < z_i + \frac{\pi(2k + 1)}{M}  \\ 
\vdots & \\
b_i e^{-j2\pi}, &  z_i + \frac{\pi(2M - 1)}{M} \leq \theta < 2\pi. \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Let 
\[
f(\theta) = \{ \hat{d}_i(\theta), i \in D \}
\]
be a function mapping the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ to a sequence of $M$-PSK symbols indexed by the elements of $D$.  Observe that $f(\theta)$ is piecewise continuous.  The subintervals of $[0, 2\pi)$ over which $f(\theta)$ remains constant are determined by the values of $\{z_i, i \in D\}$.  Let
\[
S = \{ f(\theta) \mid \theta \in [0, 2 \pi) \}
\]
be the set of all sequences $f(\theta)$ as $\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\pi$.  If $\hat{\theta}$ is the least squares estimator the phase then $S$ contains the sequence $\{ \hat{d}_i(\hat{\theta}), i \in D \}$ corresponding to the least squares estimator of the data symbols, i.e., $S$ contains the minimiser of~\eqref{eq:SSdatasymbols}.  Observe from~\eqref{eq:uicombos} that there are at most $(M+1)\abs{D}$ sequences in $S$, because there are $M+1$ sequences for each $i \in D$.

The sequences in $S$ can be enumerated as follows.  Let $\sigma$ denote the permutation of the indices in $D$ such that $z_{\sigma(i)}$ are in ascending order, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sigmasortind}
z_{\sigma(i)} \leq z_{\sigma(k)}
\end{equation}
whenever $i < k $ where $i, k \in \{0, 1, \dots, \abs{D}-1\}$.  It is convenient to define the indices into $\sigma$ to be taken modulo $\abs{D}$, that is, if $m$ is an integer not from $\{0, 1, \dots, \abs{D}-1\}$ then we define $\sigma(m) = \sigma(k)$ where $k \equiv m \mod \abs{D}$ and $k \in  \{0, 1, \dots, \abs{D}-1\}$.  The first sequence in $S$ is 
\[
f_0 = f(0) = \{ \hat{d}_i(0), i \in D \} = \{ b_i, i \in D \}.
\]  
The next sequence $f_1$ is given by replacing the element $b_{\sigma(1)}$ in $f_0$ with $b_{\sigma(1)}e^{-j2\pi/M}$.  Given a sequence $x$ we use $x e_i$ to denote $x$ with the $i$th element replaced by $x_i e^{-j2\pi/M}$.  Using this notation,  
\[
f_1 = f_0 e_{\sigma(0)}.
\] 
The next sequence in $S$ is correspondingly 
\[
f_2 = f_0 e_{\sigma(0)} e_{\sigma(1)} = f_1 e_{\sigma(1)},
\]
and the $k$th sequence is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fkrec}
f_{k+1} = f_{k} e_{\sigma(k)}.
\end{equation}
In this way, all $(M+1)\abs{D}$ sequences in $S$ can be recursively enumerated.

We want to find the $f_k \in S$ corresponding to the minimiser of~(\ref{eq:SSdatasymbols}).  A na\"{\i}ve approach would be to compute $SS(f_k)$ for each $k \in \{0,1,\dots,(M+1)\abs{D}-1\}$.  Computing $SS(f_k)$ for any particular $k$ requires $O(L)$ arithmetic operations.  So, this na\"{\i}ve approach would require $O(L (M+1) \abs{D}) = O(L^2)$ operations in total.  Following Mackenthun~\cite{Mackenthun1994}, we show how $SS(f_k)$ can be computed recursively.

Let,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SSfk}
SS(f_k) = A - \frac{1}{L}\abs{Y_k}^2,
\end{equation}
where, 
\begin{align*}
Y_k = Y( f_k ) &= \sum_{i \in P} y_i p_i^*  + \sum_{i \in D} y_i f_{ki}^* \\
&= B + \sum_{i \in D}g_{ki},
\end{align*}
where $B = \sum_{i \in P} y_i p_i^*$ is a constant, independent of the data symbols, and $f_{ki}$ denotes the $i$th symbol in $f_k$, and for convenience, we put $g_{ki}  = y_i f_{ki}^*$.  Letting $g_{k}$ be the sequence $\{g_{ik}, i \in D\}$ we have, from~\eqref{eq:fkrec}, that $g_k$ satisfies the recursive equation
\[
g_{k+1} = g_{k} e_{\sigma(k)}^*,
\]
where $g_{k} e_{\sigma(k)}^*$ indicates the sequence $g_k$ with the $\sigma(k)$th element replaced by $g_{k \sigma(k)}e^{j2\pi/M}$.  Now,
\[
Y_0 = B + \sum_{i \in D} g_{0i}
\] 
can be computed in $O(L)$ operations, and
\begin{align*}
Y_1 &= B + \sum_{i \in D} g_{1i} \\
&= B +  (e^{j2\pi/M} - 1)g_{0\sigma(0)} + \sum_{i \in D} g_{0i} \\
&= Y_0 + \eta g_{0\sigma(0)},
\end{align*}
where $\eta = e^{j2\pi/M} - 1$.  In general,
\[
Y_{k+1} = Y_k + \eta g_{k\sigma(k)}.
\]
So, each $Y_k$ can be computed from it predecessor $Y_{k-1}$ in a constant number of operations.  Given $Y_k$, the value of $SS(f_k)$ can be computed in a constant number of operations using~\eqref{eq:SSfk}.  Let $\hat{k} = \arg\min SS(f_k)$.  The least squares estimator of the complex amplitude is then computed according to~\eqref{eq:hata},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ahatYhat}
\hat{a} = \frac{1}{L} Y_{\hat{k}}.
\end{equation}
Pseudocode is given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:loglinear}.  Line~\ref{alg_sortindices} contains the function $\operatorname{sortindicies}$ that, given $z = \{z_i, i \in D\}$, returns the permutation $\sigma$ as described in~\eqref{eq:sigmasortind}.  The $\operatorname{sortindicies}$ function requires sorting $\abs{D}$ elements.  This requires $O(L \log L)$ operations.  The $\operatorname{sortindicies}$ function is the primary bottleneck in this algorithm when $L$ is large.  The loops on lines~\ref{alg_loop_setup} and~\ref{alg_loop_search} and the operations on lines~\ref{alg_Y} to lines~\ref{alg_Q} all require $O(L)$ or less operations.  %In the next sections we will show how to the sortinces function can be avoided.  This leads to an algorithm that requires only $O(L)$ operations.

\section{Circularly symmetric complex random variables}\label{sec:circ-symm-compl}

Before describing the statistical properties of the least squares estimator, we first require some properties of complex valued random variables.  A complex random variable $W$ is said to be \emph{circularly symmetric} if the distribution of its phase $\angle{W}$ is uniform on $[0,2\pi)$ and is independent of the distribution of its magnitude $\abs{W}$.  That is, if $Z \geq 0$ and $\Theta \in [0,2\pi)$ are real random variables such that $Ze^{j\Theta} = W$, then $\Theta$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,2\pi)$ and is independent of $Z$.  If the probability density function (pdf) of $Z$ is $f_Z(z)$, then the joint pdf of $\Theta$ and $Z$ is 
\[
f_{Z,\Theta}(z,\theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi}f_Z(z).
\]
Observe that for any real number $\phi$, the pdf of $W$ and $e^{j\phi}W$ are the same, that is, the pdf is invariant to phase rotation.  If $\expect\abs{W} = \expect Z$ is finite, then $W$ has zero mean because
\begin{align*}
 \expect W &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^\infty z e^{j\theta} f_{Z,\Theta}(z,\theta) dz d\theta \\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{j\theta} \int_{0}^\infty z f_Z(z) dz d\theta \\
 &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\expect Z \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{j\theta} d\theta = 0.
 \end{align*}
If $X$ and $Y$ are real random variables equal to the real and imaginary parts of $W = X + jY$ then the joint pdf of $X$ and $Y$ is
\[
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{f_Z(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})}{2\pi \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]

We will have particular use of complex random variables of the form $1 + W$ where $W$ is circularly symmetric.  Let $R \geq 0$ and $\Phi \in [0,2\pi)$ be real random variables satisfying, 
\[
R e^{j\Phi} = 1 + W.
\]
The joint pdf of $R$ and $\Phi$ can be shown to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pdfRPhi}
f(r,\phi) = \frac{r f_Z(\sqrt{\abs{r^2 - 2r\cos\phi + 1}})}{2\pi\sqrt{\abs{r^2 - 2r\cos\phi + 1}}}.
\end{equation}
The mean of $R e^{j\Phi}$ is equal to one because the mean of $W$ is zero.  So,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expectRepartRphi}
\expect \Re(R e^{j\Phi}) = \expect R \cos(\Phi) = 1,
\end{equation}
where $\Re(\cdot)$ denotes the real part, and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expectImpartRphi}
\expect \Im(R e^{j\Phi}) = \expect R \sin(\Phi) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\Im(\cdot)$ denotes the imaginary part.

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:h1minedcircsym}
% Let $X = Z e^{j\Theta}$ be a circularly symmetric complex random variable with pdf $\tfrac{1}{2\pi}f_Z(z)$.  Let $R > 0$ and $\Phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ be random variables satisfying $R e^{j\Phi} = 1 + X$.  Let
% \[
% h_1(x) = \expect R \cos(x + \Phi).
% \]
% Then $h_1(x)$ is uniquely maximised at $0$ over the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$.
% \end{lemma}
% % Before we begin the proof note that the requirement for $z^{-1}f_{Z}(z)$ to be non increasing implies that the probability density function of $Z e^{j \Theta}$ decreases as we move away from the origin. That is, the pdf of $Z e^{j \Theta}$ in rectangular coordinates is given by $z^{-1}f_{Z}(z)$, where $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $x$ and $y$ are the real and imaginary parts of $Z e^{j \Theta}$, and this pdf is non increasing with $z$.  For example, the zero mean complex Gaussian distribution with independent real and imaginary parts satisfies this requirement.

% % By the phrase ``$h_1(x)$ is uniquely maximised at $0$ over the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$'' it is meant that for any $\delta > 0$ there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that for those $x \in [-\pi, \pi]$, if 
% % \[
% % \abs{x} > \delta \qquad \text{then} \qquad  h_1(0) - h_2(x) > \epsilon.
% % \]
% % We will have further use of this definition in Section~\ref{sec:stat-prop-least}.  We are now ready to prove Lemma~\ref{lem:h1minedcircsym}.

\section{Statistical properties of the least squares estimator}\label{sec:stat-prop-least}

In this section we describe the asymptotic properties of the least squares estimator.  In what follows we use $\sfracpart{x}_\pi$ to denote $x$ taken `modulo $2\pi$' into the interval $[-\pi, \pi)$, that is
\[
\fracpart{x}_\pi = x - 2\pi\operatorname{round}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right),
\]
where $\operatorname{round}(\cdot)$ takes its argument to the nearest integer.  The direction of rounding for half-integers is not important so long as it is consistent.  We have chosen to round up half-integers here.  Similarly we use $\sfracpart{x}$ to denote $x$ taken `modulo $\tfrac{2\pi}{M}$' into the interval $\left[-\tfrac{\pi}{M}, \tfrac{\pi}{M}\right)$, that is
\[
\fracpart{x} = x - \tfrac{2\pi}{M}\operatorname{round}\left(\tfrac{M}{2\pi}x\right) = x - \round{x}.
\]
The next two theorems describe the asymptotic properties of the least squares estimator.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:consistency} (Almost sure convergence)
Let $\{w_i\}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed, circularly symmetric complex random variables with $\expect \abs{w_1}^2$ finite, and let $\{y_i, i \in P \cup D\}$ be given by~\eqref{eq:sigmod}.   Let $\hat{a} = \hat{\rho}e^{j\hat{\theta}}$ be the least squares estimator of $a_0 = \rho_0e^{j\theta_0}$. %where both $\hat{\rho}$ and $\rho_0$ are positive real numbers.  
Put $L = \abs{P \cup D}$ and let $p$ and $d$ be the limits
\[
\frac{\abs{P}}{L} \rightarrow p \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{\abs{D}}{L} \rightarrow d \qquad \text{as $L \rightarrow \infty$.}
\] 
Let $R_i \geq 0$ and $\Phi_i \in [0,2\pi)$ be real random variables satisfying
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RiandPhii}
R_ie^{j\Phi_i} = 1 + \frac{w_i}{a_0 s_i} ,
\end{equation}
and define the continuous function
\[
G(x) = p h_1(x) + d h_2(x) \qquad \text{where,}
\]
\[
h_1(x) = \expect R_1 \cos(x + \Phi_1), \;\;\; h_2(x) =  \expect R_1 \cos\sfracpart{ x + \Phi_1}.
\]
If $p > 0$ and if $\abs{G(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x = 0$ over the interval $[-\pi,\pi)$, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sfracpart{\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}}_\pi \rightarrow 0$ almost surely as $L \rightarrow \infty$,
\item $\hat{\rho} \rightarrow \rho_0 G(0)$ almost surely as $L \rightarrow \infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:normality} (Asymptotic normality)
Under the same conditions as Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency}, let $f(r,\phi)$ be the joint probability density function of $R_1$ and $\Phi_1$, let
\[
g(\phi) = \int_{0}^{\infty} r f(r,\phi) dr,
\]
and assume that $\frac{\abs{P}}{L} = p + o(L^{-1/2})$ and $\frac{\abs{D}}{L} = d + o(L^{-1/2})$.
Put $\hat{\lambda}_L = \sfracpart{\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}}_\pi$ and $\hat{m}_L = \hat{\rho} - \rho_0 G(0)$. %If $g(\phi)$ is continuous at $\phi = \tfrac{2\pi}{M}k+\tfrac{\pi}{M}$ for each $k = 0, 1, \dots M-1$, then 
Then the distribution of $(\sqrt{L}\hat{\lambda}_L, \sqrt{L}\hat{m}_L)$ converges to the bivariate normal with zero mean and covariance
\[
\left( \begin{array}{cc} 
\frac{pA_1 + dA_2}{(p + H d)^2} & 0 \\
0 & \rho_0^2(pB_1 + dB_2)
\end{array} \right)
\]
as $L \rightarrow \infty$, where
\[
H = h_2(0) -  2 \sin(\tfrac{\pi}{M}) \sum_{k = 0}^{M-1} g(\tfrac{2\pi}{M}k + \tfrac{\pi}{M}),
\]
\[
A_1 = \expect R_1^2\sin^2(\Phi_1), \qquad A_2 = \expect R_1^2\sin^2\fracpart{\Phi_1},
\]
\[
B_1 = \expect R_1^2 \cos^2(\Phi_1) - 1, \;\;\; B_2 = \expect R_1^2 \cos^2\fracpart{\Phi_1} - h_2^2(0).
\]
\end{theorem}

% \begin{corollary}\label{cor:ampmse}
% The mean square error of the amplitude estimator $\hat{\rho}$ is 
% \[
% \expect (\rho_0 - \hat{\rho})^2 = \rho_0^2\frac{p B_1 + d B_2}{L} + \rho_0^2(1 - G(0))^2 + o(L^{-1/2}).
% \] 
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{IEEEproof} Write
% \begin{align*}
% \expect (\rho_0 - \hat{\rho})^2 &= \expect \big( \rho_0(1 - G(0)) + G(0)\rho_0 - \hat{\rho} \big)^2 \\
% &= \expect \big( \rho_0(1 - G(0)) - \hat{m}_L \big)^2 \\
% &= \rho_0^2(1 - G(0))^2 + \expect \hat{m}_L^2 - 2\rho_0(1 - G(0))\expect\hat{m}_L.
% \end{align*} 
% From Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} it follows that $\expect \hat{m}_L^2 = \tfrac{B}{L} + o(L^{-1})$ and that $\expect \hat{m}_L = o(L^{-1/2})$. 
% \end{IEEEproof}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} is in Section~\ref{sec:proof-almost-sure} and the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} is in Section~\ref{sec:proof-asympt-norm}.  Before giving the proofs we discuss the assumptions made by these theorems.  The assumption that $w_1, \dots w_L$ are circularly symmetric can be relaxed, but this comes at the expense of making the theorem statements more complicated.  If $w_i$ is not circularly symmetric then the distribution of $R_i$ and $\Phi_i$ may depend on $a_0$ and also on the transmitted symbols $\{s_i,i \in P \cup D\}$.  In result, the asymptotic variance described in Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} depends on $a_0$ and $\{s_i,i \in P \cup D\}$, rather than just $\rho_0$.  The circularly symmetric assumption may not always hold in practice, but we feel it provides a sensible trade off between simplicity and generality.  

The assumption that $\expect \sabs{w_1}^2 = \expect \sabs{w_i}^2$ is finite implies that $R_i$ has finite variance since $\expect R_i^2 = 1 + \expect \abs{w_i}^2$.  This is required in Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} so that the constants $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and $B_2$ exist.  We will also use that $R_i$ has finite variance to simplify the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} by use of Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers~\cite[Theorem 2.3.10]{SenSinger_large_sample_stats_1993}


The theorems place conditions on $\sfracpart{\hat{\theta} - \theta_0}_\pi$ rather than directly on $\hat{\theta} - \theta_0$.  This makes sense because the phases $\theta_0$ and $\theta_0 + 2\pi k$ are equivalent for any integer $k$. So, for example, we expect the phases $0.49\pi$ and $-0.49\pi$ to be close together, the difference between them being $\vert\sfracpart{-0.49\pi - 0.49\pi}_\pi\vert = 0.02\pi$, and not $\vert -0.49\pi - 0.49\pi\vert = 0.98\pi$.

For Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} the integral defining $g(\phi)$ must exist at $\phi = \tfrac{2\pi}{M}k + \frac{\pi}{M}$ for $k = 0, \dots, M-1$ so that the constant $H$ exists.  The next proposition shows that the assumptions made in Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} are strong enough to ensure that the integral does exist at these points.  At the same time we derive some properties that will be useful during the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:gg2cont}
Let $W$ be a circularly symmetric complex random variable with $\expect\abs{W}^2$ finite.  Let $R > 0$ and $\Phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ be random variables satisfying $R e^{j\Phi} = 1 + W$.  Let $f(r,\phi)$ be the joint pdf of $R$ and $\Phi$.  Then
\[
g(\phi) = \int_{0}^\infty r f(r, \phi) dr,
\]
and
\[
g_2(\phi) = \int_{0}^\infty r^2 f(r, \phi) dr
\]
are even functions on $(-\pi,\pi)$ and are continuous at $\phi = \tfrac{2\pi}{M}k + \frac{\pi}{M}$ for $k = 0, \dots, M-1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{IEEEproof}
BLERG
\end{IEEEproof}

A key assumption in Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} is that $\abs{G(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x = 0$ for $x \in [-\pi, \pi)$.  This assumption asserts that $\abs{G(x)} \leq \abs{G(0)}$ for all $x \in [-\pi, \pi)$ and that if $\{x_i\}$ is a sequence of numbers from $[-\pi,\pi)$ such that $\abs{G(x_i)} \rightarrow \sabs{G(0)}$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$ then $x_i \rightarrow 0$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$.  Although we will not prove it here, this assumption is not only sufficient, but also necessary, for if $\abs{G(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at some point $x \neq 0$ then $\sfracpart{\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}}_\pi \rightarrow x$ almost surely as $L\rightarrow\infty$, while if $\abs{G(x)}$ is not uniquely maximised then $\sfracpart{\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}}_\pi$ will not converge.  The next Lemma describes a class of circularly symmetric distributions for which $\abs{G(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x = 0$.  The zero mean complex Gaussian distribution with independent real and imaginary parts is apart of this class.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:contgg2}
Let $W = X + jY$ be a circularly symmetric complex random variable, the real and imaginary parts having pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ that is nonincreasing with $x^2 + y^2$.  Let $R > 0$ and $\Phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ be random variables satisfying $R e^{j\Phi} = 1 + W$.  Let,
\[
h_1(x) = \expect R \cos(x + \Phi) \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; h_2(x) =  \expect R \cos\sfracpart{x + \Phi}.
\]
Then $\abs{h_1(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x=0$ over the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$ and $\abs{h_2(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x = 0$ over the interval $[-\tfrac{\pi}{M},\tfrac{\pi}{M}]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{IEEEproof}
BLERG
\end{IEEEproof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} defines real numbers $p$ and $d$ to represent the proportion of pilot symbols and data symbols in the limit as $L$ goes to infinity.  For Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} we need the slightly stronger condition that 
\[
\frac{\abs{P}}{L} = p + o(L^{-1/2}) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{\abs{D}}{L} = d + o(L^{-1/2})
\] 
where $o(L^{-1/2})$ denotes a number such that $\sqrt{L} o(L^{-1/2})$ goes to zero as $L\rightarrow \infty$.  This stronger condition is required to prove the asymptotic normality of $\sqrt{L}\hat{m}_L$.

% \begin{IEEEproof}
% We only give a proof for $g_2$, the proof for $g$ begin similar.  From~\eqref{eq:pdfRPhi},
% \[
% g_2(\phi) = \int_{0}^\infty \frac{r^3 f_Z(\sqrt{\sabs{r^2 - 2r\cos\phi + 1}})}{2\pi\sqrt{\sabs{r^2 - 2r\cos\phi + 1}}} dr.
% \]
% That $g_2$ is even on $[-\pi,\pi]$ is now obvious because $\cos\phi$ is even on $[-\pi,\pi]$.  Put $a = \cos\phi$ and $z^2 = r^2 - 2ra + 1$ and by a change of variable from $r$ to $z$,
% \[
% g_2(\phi) = \int_{1}^{\sqrt{1-a^2}} \frac{r^3 f_Z(z)}{2\pi ( r - a)} dz + \int_{\sqrt{1-a^2}}^\infty \frac{r^3 f_Z(z)}{2\pi ( r - a)} dz.
% \]
% when $0 < a \leq 1$ and
% \[
% g_2(\phi) = \int_{1}^\infty \frac{r^3 f_Z(z)}{2\pi ( r - a)} dz.
% \]
% when $-1 \leq a \leq 0$.  Because
% \[
% \frac{r^3}{(r - a)} \leq a z^2 +  b
% \]
% for all $\phi \in \reals$, it follows that
% \[
% g_2(\phi) \leq \int_{0}^\infty \frac{(a z^2 + d) f_Z(z)}{2\pi} dz = a \expect Z^2 + b
% \]
% which is finite.  BLERG work out a and b.
% \end{IEEEproof}



\section{Proof of almost sure convergence (Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency}) } \label{sec:proof-almost-sure}

Substituting $\{ \hat{d}_i(\theta), i \in D \}$ from~\eqref{eq:hatdfinxtheta} into~\eqref{eq:SSallparams} we obtain $SS$ conditioned on minimisation with respect to the data symbols,
 \begin{align*}
SS(\rho, \theta) &=\sum_{i \in P} \abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} p_i }^2 + \sum_{i \in D} \abs{ y_i - \rho e^{j\theta} \hat{d_i}(\theta) }^2 \\
&= A - \rho Z(\theta) - \rho Z^*(\theta) + L \rho^2,
\end{align*}
where
\[
Z(\theta)  = \sum_{i \in P} y_i e^{-j\theta} p_i^* + \sum_{i \in D} y_i e^{-j\theta} \hat{d}_i^*(\theta),
\]
and $Z^*(\theta)$ is the conjugate of $Z(\theta)$.  Differentiating with respect to $\rho$ and setting the resulting expression to zero gives the least squares estimator of $\rho_0$ as a function of $\theta$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hatrhoZ}
\hat{\rho} = \frac{Z(\theta) + Z^*(\theta)}{2L} = \frac{1}{L}\Re(Z(\theta)),
\end{equation}
where $\Re(\cdot)$ denotes the real part.  Substituting this expression into $SS(\rho, \theta)$ gives $SS$ conditioned upon minimisation with respect to $\rho$ and the data symbols,
\[
SS(\theta) = A - \frac{1}{L}\Re(Z(\theta))^2.
\]

We are interested in analysing $\hat{\theta}$, the minimiser of $SS(\theta)$, or equivalently, the maximiser of $\abs{\Re(Z(\theta))}$.  Recalling the definition of $R_i$ and $\Phi_i$ from~\eqref{eq:RiandPhii},
\begin{align*}
y_i &= a_0 s_i + w_i \\
&= a_0 s_i \left( 1 + \frac{w_i}{a_0 s_i} \right) \\
&= a_0 s_i R_i e^{j \Phi_i} \\
&= \rho_0 R_i e^{j ( \Phi_i + \theta_0 + \angle{s_i}) }.
\end{align*}
%The $\Phi_i$ can be identified as \emph{circular~random~variables}~\cite{Mardia_directional_statistics,Fisher1993,McKilliam_mean_dir_est_sq_arc_length2010}.  
Recalling the definition of $\hat{d}_i(\theta)$ and $\hat{u}_i(\theta)$ from~\eqref{eq:hatdfinxtheta},
\begin{align*}
\hat{u}_i(\theta) &= \round{\angle{y_i} - \theta} \\
&= \round{\theta_0 + \Phi_i + \angle{s_i} - \theta} \\
&\equiv \round{ \fracpart{\theta_0 - \theta}_{\pi} + \Phi_i + \angle{s_i}} \pmod{2\pi} \\
&= \round{ \lambda + \Phi_i + \angle{s_i} },
\end{align*}
where we put $\lambda = \fracpart{\theta_0 - \theta}_\pi$.  Because $\hat{d}_i^*(\theta) = e^{-j\hat{u}_i(\theta)}$, it follows that, when $i \in D$,
\begin{align}
 y_i e^{-j\theta} \hat{d}_i^*(\theta) &= \rho_0 R_i e^{j(\lambda + \Phi_i + \angle{s_i} - \round{\lambda + \Phi_i + \angle{s_i}})} \nonumber \\
&= \rho_0 R_i e^{j(\lambda + \Phi_i - \round{\lambda + \Phi_i})} \nonumber  \\
&= \rho_0 R_i e^{j\sfracpart{\lambda + \Phi_i}} \label{eq:yethetadhat}
\end{align}
since $\round{x + \angle{s_i}} = \round{x} + \angle{s_i}$ as a result of $\angle{s_i}$ being a multiple of $\tfrac{2\pi}{M}$.  Otherwise, when $i \in P$,  
\[
y_i e^{-j\theta} p_i^* = \rho_0 R_i e^{j(\lambda + \Phi_i)}.
\]
Now,
\[
Z(\theta) = \rho_0 \sum_{i \in P} R_i e^{j(\lambda + \Phi_i)} + \rho_0  \sum_{i \in D} R_i e^{j\sfracpart{\lambda + \Phi_i}},
\]
and
\[
\Re(Z(\theta)) = \rho_0 \sum_{i \in P} R_i \cos(\lambda + \Phi_i) + \rho_0 \sum_{i \in D} R_i \cos\sfracpart{\lambda + \Phi_i}.
\] 
Let 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GLdefn}
G_L(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\rho_0 L} \Re(Z(\theta))
\end{equation}
and put $\hat{\lambda}_L = \langle\theta_0 - \hat{\theta}\rangle_\pi$.  Since $\hat{\theta}$ is the maximiser of $\abs{\Re(Z(\theta))}$ then  $\hat{\lambda}_L$ is the maximiser of $\abs{G_L(\lambda)}$.  We will show that $\hat{\lambda}_L$ converges almost surely to zero as $L \rightarrow \infty$.  The proof of part 1 of the Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} follows from this.

Recall the functions $G$, $h_1$ and $h_2$ defined in the statement of Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency}.  Observe that
\[
\expect G_L(\lambda) = \frac{\abs{P}}{L} h_1(\lambda) + \frac{\abs{D}}{L} h_2(\lambda)
\]
and since $\frac{\abs{P}}{L} \rightarrow p$ and $\frac{\abs{D}}{L} \rightarrow d$ as $L \rightarrow \infty$, then
\[
\lim_{L \rightarrow\infty} \expect G_L(\lambda) = G(\lambda) = p h_1(\lambda)   +  d h_2(\lambda).
\]
As is customary, let $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \prob)$ be the probability space over which the random variables $\{w_i\}$ are defined.  Let $A$ be the subset of the sample space $\Omega$ upon which $\sabs{G(\hat{\lambda}_L)} \rightarrow \sabs{G(0)}$ as $L\rightarrow\infty$.  Lemma~\ref{lem:convtoexpGlamL} shows that $\prob\{A\} = 1$.  Let $A'$ be the subset of the sample space upon which $\hat{\lambda}_L \rightarrow 0$ as $L\rightarrow \infty$.  Because $\sabs{G(x)}$ is uniquely maximised at $x=0$, it follows that $\sabs{G(\hat{\lambda}_L)} \rightarrow \sabs{G(0)}$ only if $\hat{\lambda}_L \rightarrow 0$ as $L \rightarrow\infty$. So $A \subseteq A'$ and therefore $\prob\{A'\} \geq \prob\{A\} = 1$.  Part 1 of Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency} follows.  

It remains to prove part 2 of the theorem regarding the convergence of the amplitude estimator $\hat{\rho}$.  From~\eqref{eq:hatrhoZ},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rhoGLZ}
\hat{\rho} = \frac{1}{L}\Re(Z(\hat{\theta})) = \rho_0 G_L(\hat{\lambda}_L).
\end{equation}  
Lemma~\ref{lem:GLtoG0} shows that $G_L(\hat{\lambda}_L)$ converges almost surely to $G(0)$ as $L\rightarrow\infty$, and $\hat{\rho}$ consequently converges almost surely to $\rho_0 G(0)$ as required.  It remains to prove Lemmas~\ref{lem:convtoexpGlamL} and~\ref{lem:GLtoG0}.  These are proved in Section~\ref{sec:proof-almost-sureappendix} of \cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKpilotsdata_2012appendix}.

\section{Proof of asymptotic normality (Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}) } \label{sec:proof-asympt-norm}

We first prove the asymptotic normality of $\sqrt{L} \hat{\lambda}_L$.  Once this is done we will be able to prove the normality of $\sqrt{L} m_L$.  Recall that $\hat{\lambda}_L$ is the maximiser of the function $G_L$ defined in~\eqref{eq:GLdefn}.  The proof is complicated by the fact that $G_L$ is not differentiable everywhere due to the function $\fracpart{\cdot}$ not being differentiable at multiples of $\tfrac{\pi}{M}$.  This prevents the use of ``standard approaches'' to proving normality that are based on the mean value theorem~\cite{vonMises_diff_stats_1947,vanDerVart1971_asymptotic_stats,Pollard_new_ways_clts_1986,Pollard_conv_stat_proc_1984,Pollard_asymp_empi_proc_1989}.  However, we show in Lemma~\ref{lem:diffatlambdaL} that the derivative $G_L^\prime$ does exist, and is equal to zero, at $\hat{\lambda}_L$. Define the function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RLdef}
R_L(\lambda) = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i \in P} R_i \sin(\lambda + \Phi_i) + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i \in D} R_i \sin\sfracpart{\lambda + \Phi_i}.
\end{equation}
Whenever $G_L(\lambda)$ is differentiable $G_L^\prime(\lambda) = R_L(\lambda)$ so $R_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) = G_L^\prime(\hat{\lambda}_L) = 0$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:diffatlambdaL}.  Let $Q_L(\lambda) = \expect R_L(\lambda) - \expect R_L(0)$ and write
\begin{align*}
0 &= R_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) + Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) \\
&= \sqrt{L}\big( R_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) \big) + \sqrt{L}Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L).
\end{align*}
Lemma~\ref{lem:Qconv} shows that
\[
\sqrt{L} Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) = \sqrt{L} \hat{\lambda}_L\big( p + Hd  + o_P(1) \big)
\]
where $o_P(1)$ denotes a number converging in probability to zero as $L \rightarrow \infty$, and the constants $p,d$ and $H$ are defined in the statement of Theorems~\ref{thm:consistency}~and~\ref{thm:normality}.  Lemma~\ref{lem:empiricprocc} shows that
\[
\sqrt{L}\big( R_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - Q_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) \big) = o_P(1) + \sqrt{L} R_L(0).
\]
It follows from the three equations above that,
\[
0 = o_P(1) + \sqrt{L}R_L(0) + \sqrt{L} \hat{\lambda}_L \big( p + Hd  + o_P(1) \big)
\]
and rearranging gives,
\[
\sqrt{L} \hat{\lambda}_L = o_P(1) - \frac{\sqrt{L}R_L(0)}{p + Hd  + o_P(1)}.
\]
Lemma~\ref{lem:convdistGLdash} shows that the distribution of $\sqrt{L}R_L(0)$ converges to the normal with zero mean and variance $pA_1 + dA_2$ where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are real constants defined in the statement of Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}.  It follows that the distribution of $\sqrt{L}\hat{\lambda}_L$ converges to the normal with zero mean and variance
\[
\frac{pA_1 + dA_2}{(p + Hd)^2}.
\]
 
We now analyse the asymptotic distribution of $\sqrt{L} m_L$.  Let $T_L(\lambda) = \expect G_L(\lambda)$.  Using~\eqref{eq:rhoGLZ},
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{L} m_L &= \sqrt{L} \rho_0 \big( G_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - G(0) \big) \\
&= \sqrt{L} \rho_0 \big( G_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - T_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) + T_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - G(0) \big).
\end{align*}
Lemma~\ref{lem:empiricprocforrho} shows that 
\[
\sqrt{L}\big( G_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - T_L(\hat{\lambda}_L)  \big) = o_P(1) + X_L,
\]
where $X_L = \sqrt{L}\big( G_L(0) - T_L(0)  \big)$.  Lemma~\ref{lem:HLtoG} shows that
\[
%\sqrt{L}\big( T_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - G(0) \big) = \sqrt{L} \hat{\lambda}_L \big( ? + o_P(1) \big).
\sqrt{L}\big( T_L(\hat{\lambda}_L) - G(0) \big) = o_P(1).
\]
It follows that $\sqrt{L} m_L =  \rho_0 X_L + o_P(1)$.  Lemma~\ref{lem:XL} shows that the distribution of $X_L$ converges to the normal with zero mean and variance $p B_1 + d B_2$ as $L\rightarrow\infty$ where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are defined in the statement of Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}.  Thus, the distribution of $\sqrt{L} m_L$ converges to the normal with zero mean and variance $\rho_0^2(p B_1 + d B_2)$ as required.  Because $X_L$ does not depend on $\hat{\lambda}_L$, it follows that $\covar(X_L, \sqrt{L}\hat{\lambda}_L) = 0$, and so,
\[
\covar(\sqrt{L}\hat{m}_L, \sqrt{L}\hat{\lambda}_L) = \covar(\rho_0 X_L + o_P(1), \sqrt{L}\hat{\lambda}_L) \rightarrow 0
\]
as $L \rightarrow \infty$.  It remains to prove the lemmas that we have used.  These lemmas are proved in Section~\ref{sec:proof-asympt-normappendix} of~\cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKpilotsdata_2012appendix}.



\section{The Gaussian noise case}\label{sec:gaussian-noise-case}

Let the noise sequence $\{w_i\}$ be complex Gaussian with independent real and imaginary parts having zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.  The joint density function of the real and imaginary parts is
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-(x^2 + y^2)/\sigma^2}
\]
Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency}~and~\ref{thm:normality} hold and, since the distribution of $w_1$ is circularly symmetric, the distribution of $R_1e^{j\Phi_1}$ is identical to the distribution of $1 + \frac{1}{\rho_0} w_1$.
%and the joint density function of the real and imaginary parts of $Z$ is
%\[
%p_Z(x,y) = \rho_0^2 p( \rho_0 (x - 1), \rho_0 y ) = \frac{\kappa^2}{2\pi}e^{-\kappa^2(x ^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2) }
%\] 
%where $\kappa = \tfrac{\rho_0}{\sigma}$.  
It can be shown that
\[
g(\phi) = \frac{\cos^2(\phi)}{4\sqrt{\pi}}\left( \frac{e^{-\kappa^2} }{\sqrt{\pi}} + \kappa \Psi(\phi)  e^{-\kappa^2\sin^2(\phi)}\cos(\phi) \right)
\]
where $\kappa = \rho_0/\sigma$ and
\[
\Psi(\phi) = 1 + \erf(\kappa \cos(\phi)) = 1 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^{\kappa \cos(\phi)} e^{-t^2} dt .
\]
The value of $A_1, A_2, B_1$ and $B_2$ can be efficiently computed by numerical integration using these formula.


\section{Simulations}\label{sec:simulations}

We present the results of Monte-Carlo simulations with the least squares estimator.  In all simulations the noise $w_1,\dots,w_L$ is independent and identically distributed circularly symmetric and Gaussian with real and imaginary parts having variance $\sigma^2$.  Under these conditions the least squares estimator is also the maximum likelihood estimator.  Simulations are run with $M=2,4,8$ (BPSK and QPSK and $8$-PSK) and with signal to noise ratio $\text{SNR} = \tfrac{\rho_0^2}{2\sigma^2}$ between \unit[-20]{dB} and \unit[20]{dB}.  The amplitude $\rho_0=1$ and $\theta_0$ is uniformly distributed on $[-\pi, \pi)$.  For each value of SNR, $T = 5000$ replications are performed to obtain $T$ estimates $\hat{\rho}_1, \dots, \hat{\rho}_T$ and $\hat{\theta}_1, \dots, \hat{\theta}_T$.  

Figures~\ref{fig:plotphaseBPSK},~\ref{fig:plotphaseQPSK}~and~\ref{fig:plotphase8PSK} show the mean square error (MSE) of the phase estimator when $M=2,4,8$ with $L=4096$ and for varying proportions of pilots symbols $\abs{P} = 0, \tfrac{L}{2}, \tfrac{L}{8}, \tfrac{L}{32}, L$.  When $\abs{P} \neq 0$ (i.e. coherent detection) the mean square error is computed as $\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T\sfracpart{\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_0}_\pi^2$.  Otherwise, when $\abs{P}=0$ the mean square error is computed as $\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T\sfracpart{\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_0}^2$ as in~\cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKnoncoICASSP_2012}.  The dots, squares, circles and crosses are the results of Monte-Carlo simulations with the least square estimator.  The solid lines are the MSEs predicted by Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}.  The theorem accurately predicts the behaviour of the phase estimator when $L$ is sufficiently large and when the SNR is not too small.  As the SNR decreases the variance of the phase estimator approaches that of the uniform distribution on $[-\pi, \pi)$ when $\abs{P} \neq 0$ and the uniform distribution on $[-\tfrac{\pi}{M}, \tfrac{\pi}{M})$ when $\abs{P}=0$~\cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKnoncoICASSP_2012}.  Theorem~\ref{thm:normality} does not model this behaviour.

Figures~\ref{fig:plotampBPSK},~\ref{fig:plotampQPSK}~and~\ref{fig:plotamp8PSK} show the variance of the amplitude estimator when $M=2,4,8$ and with $L=32, 256, 2048$ and when the number of pilots symbols is $\abs{P} = 0, \tfrac{L}{2}, L$.  The solid lines are the variance predicted by Theorem~\ref{thm:normality}.  The dots and crosses show the results of Monte-Carlo simulations.  Each point is computed as $\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T\big(\hat{\rho}_i - \rho_0G(0)\big)^2$.  This requires $G(0)$ to be known.  In practice $G(0)$ may not be known at the receiver, so Figures~\ref{fig:plotampBPSK},~\ref{fig:plotampQPSK}~and~\ref{fig:plotamp8PSK} serve to validate the correctness of our asymptotic theory, rather than to suggest the practical performance of the amplitude estimator.  When SNR is large $G(0)$ is close to $1$ and the bias of the amplitude estimator is small.  However, $G(0)$ grows without bound as the variance of the noise increases, so the bias is significant when SNR is small.

Figure~\ref{fig:plotphaseQPSKmultL} shows the MSE of the phase estimator when $M=4$ and $L=32,256, 2048$ and the number of pilots is $\abs{P}=\tfrac{L}{8},L$.  The figure depicts an interesting phenomenon.  When $L=2048$ and $\abs{P} = \tfrac{L}{8} = 256$ the number of pilots symbols is the same as when $L=\abs{P} = 256$.  When the SNR is small (approximately less than \unit[0]{dB}) the least squares estimator using the $256$ pilots symbols and also the $2048-256=1792$ data symbols performs \emph{worse} than the estimator that uses only the $256$ pilots symbols.  A similar phenomenon occurs when $L=256$ and $\abs{P} = \tfrac{L}{8} = 32$.  %When the SNR is small it is better to ignore the data symbols and use only the pilot symbols.  
This behaviour suggests modifying the objective function to give the pilots symbols more importance when the SNR is low.  For example, rather the minimise~\eqref{eq:SSdefn} we could instead minimise a weighted version of it,
\[
SS_{\beta}(a, \{d_i, i \in D\}) = \sum_{i \in P} \abs{ y_i - a s_i }^2 + \beta \sum_{i \in D} \abs{ y_i - a d_i }^2,
\]
where the weight $\beta$ would be small when SNR is small and near $1$ when SNR is large.  For fixed $\beta$ the asymptotic properties of this weighted estimator could be derived using the techniques we have developed in Sections~\ref{sec:stat-prop-least},~\ref{sec:proof-almost-sure} and~\ref{sec:proof-asympt-norm} and also in~\cite{McKilliam_leastsqPSKpilotsdata_2012appendix}.  This would enable a rigorous theory for selection of $\beta$ at the receiver.  One caveat is that the receiver would require knowledge about the noise distribution in order to advantageously choose $\beta$.  We do not investigate this further here.

\section{Conclusion}

We considered least squares estimators of carrier phase and amplitude from noisy communications signals that contain both pilot signals, known to the receiver, and data signals, unknown to the receiver.  We focused on $M$-ary phase shift keying constellations.  The least squares estimator can be computed in $O(L\log L)$ operations using a modification of an algorithm due to Mackenthun~\cite{Mackenthun1994}, and is the maximum likelihood estimator in the case that the noise is additive white and Gaussian.  

We showed, under some conditions on the distribution of the noise, that the phase estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is strongly consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.  However, the amplitude estimator $\hat{\rho}_0$ is biased, and converges to $G(0)\rho_0$.  This bias is large when the signal to noise ratio is small.  It would be interesting to investigate methods for correcting this bias.  A method for estimating $G(0)$ at the receiver appears to be required.

Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the performance of the least squares estimator and also to validate our asymptotic theory.  Interestingly, when the SNR is small, it is counter productive to use the data symbols to estimate the phase (Figure~\ref{fig:plotphaseQPSKmultL}).  This suggests the use of a weighed objective function, which would be an interesting topic for future research.
